Azure Availability Zones
Azure Availability Zones are physically separate data centers within an Azure region, each equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking infrastructure.
 This design ensures fault isolation, meaning a failure in one zone, such as a power outage or network issue, does not affect the others.
 Each zone is a distinct location, and a region with Availability Zone support must have at least three separate zones.

When you deploy a virtual machine (VM) or a Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS) and select an Availability Zone (e.g., Zone 1, 2, or 3), you are placing that resource within the corresponding physical data center.
 Selecting a single zone, like Zone 1, means the VM is created only within that specific zone.
 However, to achieve high availability and fault tolerance against data center failures, you should deploy your resources across multiple zones.
 For example, if you select all three zones (1, 2, and 3) during VM creation, Azure will create a separate VM instance in each zone.

For Virtual Machine Scale Sets, you can configure them to be zone-redundant by specifying multiple zones in the deployment configuration, such as "zones": ["1", "2", "3"].
 This spreads instances across all selected zones, providing a 99.99% SLA for the scale set.
 The scale set can be configured to balance instances across zones either with best-effort balance (the default) or strict balance.
 In the event of a zonal outage, instances in the affected zone may be impacted, but those in other zones remain operational.
 The scale set can continue to scale out by adding new instances to the unaffected zones.

It is important to note that Availability Zones are not a replication mechanism for a single VM. Selecting a zone for a single VM does not automatically create replicas in other zones; you must explicitly configure your deployment to span multiple zones to achieve redundancy.
 For stateless workloads, it is recommended to use at least two Availability Zones to improve resiliency.
